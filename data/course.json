  "course_description": "Drama combines the literary arts of storytelling and poetry with the world of live performance.\u00a0As a form of ritual as well as entertainment, drama has served to unite communities and challenge social norms, to vitalize and disturb its audiences.\u00a0In order to understand this rich art form more fully, we will study and discuss a sampling of plays that exemplify different kinds of dramatic structure; class members will also participate in, attend, and review dramatic performances.\n",
